**Pearson Correlation Coefficient**

The **Pearson correlation coefficient** is a statistical measure that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges between **-1** and **1**, where:

- **1**: Perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases).
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
- **0**: No linear correlation (the variables have no linear relationship).

A high positive or negative value indicates a strong relationship, while values close to 0 suggest a weak or no relationship. Itâ€™s commonly used in feature selection to evaluate the impact of each feature on the target variable.

For example, in housing data, a Pearson correlation coefficient of **0.70** between the number of rooms (`rm`) and the median house price (`medv`) suggests a **strong positive correlation**, meaning houses with more rooms tend to have higher prices.
