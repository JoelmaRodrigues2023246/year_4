# Year 4 - BSc (Hons) in Computing
CCT College Dublin

This repo is where I'll keep everything I'm working on during my final year of the **BSc (Hons) in Computing** at CCT College Dublin — all the material, code, and tutorials I develop along the way.

## Modules
I've organized the repo into folders for the modules that need coding:

1. [**Artificial Intelligence**](./ArtificialIntelligence)
2. [**Data Preparation & Exploration**](./DataPreparationAndExploration)
3. [**Data Visualisation & Communication**](./DataVisualisation&Communication)

## Data Preparation & Exploration
**Lecturer:** Muhammad Iqbal  

### Description
Here, I'll be diving into data prep and exploration — things like data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis.

## Data Visualisation & Communication
**Lecturer:** Sam Weiss  

### Description
In this module, I'll be focusing on best practices for data visualization and how to communicate insights from big datasets in a clear and visual way.

I'll keep updating the repo as I work through the tutorials and projects for each module, at my own pace, focusing on the code and practical stuff I'm learning!
